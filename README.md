After trying out Bento for a while, I decided that it was a bit too much for my needs and I wanted to try making my own version. I haven't worked all that much on it yet, just getting it to a state where the page is fit for daily use, but in the future I plan to add the ability to swap between several preset weather reports / time zones, more custom time of day messages based on holidays or similar, and the ability to change links without rebuilding the project.
